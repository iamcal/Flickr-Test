Flickr::Test
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Flickr PHP/Perl test harness thingy, based on Test::Harness.

To get up and running, type this command in this dirctory:

	perl -Ilib -MFlickr::Test -eruntests example.php.t

This will use the harness to run the example test.

Once you're happy, install the module by doing:

perl Build.pl
./Build
./Build test
./Build install

(The install step may require sudo)

Then the command to run a test becomes:

	perl -MFlickr::Test -eruntests <<test_name(s)>>

If you leave out <<test_name(s)>>, it looks for "t/*.t" and 
"t/*/*.t" in the current directory.



What is this doing?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a wrapper around Test::Harness that also knows how to run 
tests written in PHP. Just name them *.php.t for it to work. Inside
your PHP tests, you can add this line:

	include('Flickr/Test/Straps.php');

This imports some functions equivalent to Test::Simple to make it
easy to define basic tests. The harness makes sure straps.php is
in the PHP include path. See the example.php.t file for an example.
